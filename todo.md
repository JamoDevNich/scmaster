# Todo List
- JQuery and Semantic to be installed via npm instead
- tidy JS
- Optimise code for Next/Prev song checking
- Proper detection for master computer units/possibly unify both Vue instances to a single instance
- Tidy and sort failed connection code
- When the end of the songlist is reached, if the last song is locked the fast forward cannot go back to the first song. change to a for loop.

# Issues
- Track play buttons on main interface need better way to communicate song Id back to Vue
