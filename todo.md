# Todo List
- JQuery and Semantic to be installed via npm instead
- ~~tidy JS~~
- ~~Optimise code for Next/Prev song checking~~
- Proper detection for master computer units
- ~~Tidy and sort failed connection code~~
- ~~When the end of the songlist is reached, if the last song is locked the fast forward cannot go back to the first song. change to a for loop~~

## Issues
- ~~Track play buttons on main interface need better way to communicate song Id back to Vue~~ (resolved - by not handling the song)
- Soft Unrecoverable: User presented with channel input screen, user starts entering channel id. Server disconnects and reconnects during that time. User is presented with unrec error screen. (2/10 severity)
